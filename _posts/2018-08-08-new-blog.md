title: What these posts will be about.

Hi!

Under my PhD program, I currently work on the topics of Machine learning from an energy-use point of view. I was able to do do things like measure the per-layer energy of a Convolutional Neural Network model on a mobile platform, understand its energy consumption behaviour from the perspective of computations being performed and data movement in memory and build energy predictive models etc.

SyNERGY is framework built by integrating a deep learning framework such as Caffe2 and ARM Streamline Performance Analyser on the Jetson TX1 and Snapdragon 820. Scripts on how to set this framework on your system is under progress in this Github repo: https://github.com/Crefeda/SyNERGY

So, I am starting this series of technical blog posts that will cover topics related to 
- Machine learning
- Power profiling
- Energy and performance metrics
- Green AI
