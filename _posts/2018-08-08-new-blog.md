Hi!

I currently work on the topics of Machine learning from an energy-use point of view. I am able to do things like measure the per-layer energy of a Convolutional Neural Network model on a mobile platform, understand its energy consumption behaviour from the perspective of computations being performed and data movement in memory and build energy predictive models etc.

During my PhD, I developed a framework called "SyNERGY", by integrating a deep learning framework such as Caffe/Caffe2 and ARM Streamline Performance Analyser for the Jetson TX1 and Snapdragon 820. Scripts on how to set this framework on your system is under progress in this Github repo: https://github.com/Crefeda/SyNERGY

So, I am starting this series of technical blog posts that will cover topics related to 
- Machine learning
- Power profiling
- Energy and performance metrics
- Green AI
