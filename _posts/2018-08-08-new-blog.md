title: What these posts will be about.

Hi!
During my PhD I was able to work topics of Machine learning from an energy-use point of view. I was able to do do things like measure the per-layer energy of a Convolutional Neural Network model on a mobile platform, understand its energy consumption behaviour from the perspective of computations being performed and data movement in memory and build energy predictive models etc.

Scripts on how to set up your system to do power profiling is under progress in this Gihub repo: https://github.com/Crefeda/SyNERGY

SyNERGY is framework built by integrating a deep learning framework such as Caffe2 and ARM Streamline Performance Analyser on the Jetson TX1 and Snapdragon 820.

So, I am starting this series of technical blog posts that will cover topics related to 
 -Machine learning
 -Power profiling
 -Energy and performance metrics
 -Green AI
