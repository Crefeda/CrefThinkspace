Hi! My name is Crefeda Faviola Rodrigues. I am from the sunny and beautiful land of Goa! I am a PhD student at the Advanced Processors Technology (APT) group at The University of Manchester.

I work at the intersection of systems research and machine learning. I am interested in Machine learning, Heterogenous computing and Green Computing.
